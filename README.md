PENTAGON
---------------------

You may find all rules and controls in HELP menu.

Rules
---------------------
Your goal is to place figures-pentaminoes (they consist of 5 squares hence the name) (furthermore, that's why
this game is called so) on the field 12x12 so they do not overlap each other even with corners (you create a
mosaic)

Controls 
---------------------
LMB - choose a figure  
RMB - place figure back to desk  
MMB - use help, place chosen figure on place, computed by program (this way you can speedrun a game)  
Space - rotate a figure  
Arrows - move a figure
