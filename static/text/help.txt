Pentagon is a logic puzzle game.
Here you are given with a set of figures - so called `pentaminoes`.
Your goal is to place those pentaminoes on the field so they
do not intersect among themselves even with their corners.
Gray cells on the screen are obstacles, pentaminoes should
not be placed on them. To make completion easier, you will have
a help - you can place any figure on its place as it was
determined by a computer.

> Left mouse button - activate the figure (select it)
> Right mouse button - place a figure back on start desk
> Middle mouse button - help: place a selected figure on place as computer determined
> Arrows - move the figure around the field
> Space - rotate the figure
